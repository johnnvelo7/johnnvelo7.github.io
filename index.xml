      <title>Indirect Payload (Miscellaneous) Huntress CTF Writeup</title>

      <description>INDIRECT PAYLOAD WRITEUP Visiting the website we get this page: Clicking on the button will redirect us to another url:
And then we get error message.
I then decided to see what is happening using burpsuite.
Here I see that we get a new site that we can follow, so I decided to follow it manually, and after 2 more redirections we see the first character of the flag.
This is when I realized that the flag is scattered through all the URLs that we are forced to redirect to.</description>

      <description>path_watcher CTF TOOL:
https://github.com/johnnvelo7/path_watcher
Monitor a directory for files created and closed after writing events. It displays the contents of the file after it&amp;rsquo;s written. This is useful for CTF&amp;rsquo;s where you need to dynamically analyse a malware especially if the malware is creating and deleting a file (flag.txt) in microseconds.
TAKE NOTE:
This program currently only works for Linux OS, but I&amp;rsquo;ll add support for windows soon.
HOW TO USE: Install the required package (pyinotify): pip install pyinotify or pip3 install pyinotify</description>
