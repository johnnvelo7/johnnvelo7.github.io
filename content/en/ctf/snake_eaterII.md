# Snake Eater II - Writeup
After unzipping this file, I checked first what kind of file this malware is. 

```file snake_eaterII.exe```

Seems familiar to the previous challenge so I decided to check it in windows too. I saw that it had the same icon as the previous challenge.

I figured that this challenge might have the same solution as the previous one so I ran ***procmon*** to see what it was doing, perhaps on the same path directory as Snake Eater. 

While dynamically analyzing the malware, I got to see some interesting files that were ***created*** and ***deleted*** in ***microseconds***.

I tried to open the directory given to see if the flag is there, but it seems to be getting deleted really fast. I also found out that *flag.txt* is getting created on random folders after the /AppData/Roaming. This was a problem for me because I have multiple folders in that path, so catching the flag will be a bit difficult. That was when I decided that to do everything in *Kali Linux* since I only have 1 folder in that path through *wine*. 

First, I used ***‚Äúinotifywait‚Äù*** program to see if it was catching the creation and deletion of file in the directory. (Install this first if you don‚Äôt have it)

Using ***wine***, I was able to run some windows executables inside Kali. And just as I thought, I was able to catch the creation of the ***flag.txt*** (Install wine first If you don‚Äôt have it)

The only problem left now is to make a python script that can read this file REALLY fast. That was when I decided to create a python program called ***PATH_WATCHER*** that can do just that! (shameless plug).

After running the script on the same path, I was able to retrieve the flag that was created. üòä
