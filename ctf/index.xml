      <description>INDIRECT PAYLOAD WRITEUP Visiting the website we get this page: Clicking on the button will redirect us to another url:
And then we get error message.
I then decided to see what is happening using burpsuite.
Here I see that we get a new site that we can follow, so I decided to follow it manually, and after 2 more redirections we see the first character of the flag.
This is when I realized that the flag is scattered through all the URLs that we are forced to redirect to.</description>
